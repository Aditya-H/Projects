This folder contains projects where I learn to analyze data with python
1) Real Estate Investment Trust Analysis  - 
  In this project, I analyzed Real Estate Investment Trusts, commonly known as REITs. REITs are companies that own or operate real estate that produces           income. REITs, like the stocks of regular public companies, are traded on different stock exchanges. Investing in a REIT allows you to invest in portfolios of   real estate assets the same way you can invest in a company by buying its stock. Using financial statistics and NumPy I analyzed two REITs: Sabra Health Care   REIT Inc. (NASDAQ: SBRA), which invests in health care real estate, and Equity Residential (NASDAQ:EQR), which invests in rental apartment properties.

2) A/B Testing for ShoeFly.com - Our favorite online shoe store, ShoeFly.com is performing an A/B Test. They have two different versions of an ad, which they have placed in emails, as well as in banner ads on Facebook, Twitter, and Google. They want to know how the two ads are performing on each of the different platforms on each day of the week. Help them analyze the data using aggregate measures.
