This folder contains projects where I visualise data using python and its packages

1) Sublime Limes' Line Graphs - In this project, you will be acting as a data analyst for an online lime retailer called Sublime Limes. People all over the world can use this product to get the freshest, best-quality limes delivered to their door. One of the product managers at Sublime Limes would like to gain insight into the customers and their sales habits. Using Matplotlib, you’ll create some different line graphs (or maybe, lime graphs) to communicate this information effectively.

2) Chocolate Scraping with Beautiful Soup - Some questions we thought about when we found this dataset were:

    Where are the best cocao beans grown?
    Which countries produce the highest-rated bars?
    What’s the relationship between cocao solids percentage and rating?

Can we find a way to answer these questions, or uncover more questions, using BeautifulSoup and Pandas?

3) Visualizing World Cup Data With Seaborn - For this project you will be exploring data from the Fifa World Cup from 1930-2014 to analyze trends and discover insights about the world’s game, fútbol! This Fifa World Cup data is from Kaggle. Kaggle is a platform for data science competitions that hosts many datasets online. Using Seaborn you will create a series of plots that explore aggregates and distribution across the goals scored in World Cup games.

4) Visualize Netflix data using Python - 
During this project, I analyzed, prepared, and plot data. My visualizations will help asses the risk of the Netflix stock.
